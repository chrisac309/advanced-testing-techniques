# Advanced Testing Techniques in XUnit

Using this repository, we'll be discussing unit testing within C#.  This will go over topics such as:
- AutoFixture
- Frozen Attribute
- Mock/Moq
- sut
- AutoData/InlineAutoData
- Fluent Assertions
- Code Coverage Analysis
- Add Watch, debugging
- Live unit testing
- TDD
- Running tests automatically

## Prerequisites

Going into this discussion, it is assumed that you have a general understanding of what a unit test accomplishes, and you have an understanding of how to write a unit test in MSTest, XUnit, or NUnit.  In this instance, we'll be using XUnit exclusively.
